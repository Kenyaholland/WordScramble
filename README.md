# **WordScramble**

## Description
This is a dice game I found online, but was unable to purchase the physical version. So I decided to make it!
I made 3D models of the dice in Blender, UV unwrapped them, and traced the letters on each side of the dice manually with
Adobe Substance 3D Painter. As you are playing the game, you can see my use of normal maps as well where the black letters 
indent on the dice. 

### Objective
It's simple. Roll the dice. Make words with the letters and join them together in a Scrabble like style.

As you can see, I didn't solve this puzzle. Maybe you can!

## **Set-up instructions**

## **Controls**
1. **Hold left mouse button** to move a dice around.
2. **W and E keys** - While holding left mouse button on a dice, hold "E" or "W" to rotate left and right.
3. **Space** - Rolls the dice. I would hit it 2 - 3 times consecutively to get a solid roll.
5. **Esc** - This game is fullscreen, so click esc to exit the game.
